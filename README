What is it?
-----------

app_my provides the most commonly used subset of app_mysql's feature set.
It currently only provides one application, MyQuery, and one function, MY_ESC.
A few commands are also available; they have the "my" prefix.

MyQuery:
  MyQuery("query") will perform the SQL query given as the argument. If the
  query returns a SELECT-like recordset, then MyQuery will export those as
  channel variables. Other rows will be ignored silently.

  Example: "SELECT foo, bar FROM table" will result in the following variables
  to be exported: MY_FOO and MY_BAR.

MY_ESC:
  MY_ESC("foo") will escape the provided text so it can be used within a query.

Configuration
-------------
app_my curently steals the configuration from cdr_mysql.conf.
